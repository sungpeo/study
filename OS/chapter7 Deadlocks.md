# Chapter7. Deadlocks

Sometimes, a waiting process is never again able to change state, because the resources it has requested are held by other waiting processes. This situation is called a deadlock.

## Chapter Objectives

* To develop a description of deadlocks, which prevent sets of concurrent processes from completing their tasks.
* To present a number of different methods for preventing or avoiding deadlocks in a computer system.

## 7.1 System Model

Under the normal mode of operation, a process may utilize a resource in only the following sequence:

1. Request. The process requests the resource. If the request cannot be granted immediately (for example, if the resource is being used by another process), then the requesting process must wait until it can acquire the resource.
2. Use. The process can operate on the resource (for example, if the resource is a printer, the process can print on the printer).
3. Release. The process releases the resource.

A set of processes is in a deadlocked state when every process in the set is waiting for an event that can be caused only by another process in the set.

## 7.2 Dealock Characterization

### 7.2.1 Necessary Conditions

A deadlock situation can arise if the following four conditions hold simultaneously in a system:

1. Mutual exclusion. At least one resource must be held in a nonsharable mode; that is, only one process at a time can use the resource. If another process requests that resource, the requesting process must be delayed until the resource has been released.
2. Hold and wait. A process must be holding at least one resource and waiting to acquire additional resources that are currently being held by other processes.
3. No preemption. Resources cannot be preempted; that is, a resource can be released only voluntarily by the process holding it, after that process has completed its task.
4. Circular wait. A set {P0, P1, ..., Pn} of waiting processes must exist such that P0 is waiting for a resource held by P1, P1 is waiting for a resource held by P2, ..., Pnâˆ’1 is waiting for a resource held by Pn, and Pn is waiting for a resource held by P0.

The circular-wait condition implies the hold-and-wait condition, so the four conditions are not completely independent.
